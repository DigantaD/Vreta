A Machine Learning and Morse Code based Hacking Application.

A hacking application which will use Machine Learning to send ping requests to the open ports of the protocol range received and therefore decide the vulnerable ports in which we can gain access through hacking which will also use complex Machine Learning algorithms. This application will use JAVA as the primary language and other related languages such as Scala, NodeJS, JFlex, etc. , to convert tracked open ports of TCP/IP protocols into Morse codes and transmit it using miniature sound waves. The tracking part will use the JAVA Network Programming framework. When it reaches the base receiver system, automatic key loggers , password decryptors and hash generators, etc. will be generated to hack into any social network, system or any other web network, after the Morse codes are decrypted using ML. The ML part will take the use of C, C++, Arduino Programming.
